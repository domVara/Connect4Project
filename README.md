# Connect4Project

#Description:

The project tries to automate the connect four game with an unbeatable agent to play the game.

To run the game type the following command on the terminal/Bash:

```
python3 connect.py
```

The program makes the human first move and asks the user to choose the column he wants  to put the piece in. 

The  AI generates inferences and takes his turn.

The game is terminated if either one of the player wins or  the game draws.
